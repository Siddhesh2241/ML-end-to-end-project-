# End to End Machine learning Project

## 🎓 Student Exam Performance Prediction 📊

Predicting student performance based on demographic and preparatory factors using a machine learning model.

**🌟 Project Overview**

This project is a full End-to-End Machine Learning Web Application that predicts a student's math exam score based on inputs like gender, parental education, test preparation, and more. The application provides a seamless interface for users to enter information and receive predictions for academic performance in real-time.
