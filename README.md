# End to End Machine learning Project

## 🎓 Student Exam Performance Prediction 📊

Predicting student performance based on demographic and preparatory factors using a machine learning model.

**🌟 Project Overview**

This project is a full End-to-End Machine Learning Web Application that predicts a student's math exam score based on inputs like gender, parental education, test preparation, and more. The application provides a seamless interface for users to enter information and receive predictions for academic performance in real-time.

**📦 Getting Started**

**Prerequisites**
* Install Python >= 3.7
* Install Docker (optional, for containerized deployment)

**Installation**

* 1) Clone the repo:
      git clone https://github.com/yourusername/student-performance-prediction.git
      cd student-performance-prediction

* 2) Install dependencies:
     pip install -r requirements.txt

* 3) Run the app:
     python app.
     
**🎛️ Model Training and Hyperparameter Tuning**

Run model training with hyperparameter tuning by configuring parameters in train_pipeline.py. This setup uses multiple algorithms (e.g., n_estimators for Random Forest) for optimized performance.

from sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV

param_grid = {
    'RandomForestRegressor': {
        'n_estimators': [100, 200, 300],
        'max_depth': [10, 20, None]
    },
    'XGBRegressor': {
        'learning_rate': [0.01, 0.1, 0.2],
        'n_estimators': [100, 200]
    }
}

**🌍 Usage**
* Open your browser and go to http://127.0.0.1:5000.
* Fill in the details like gender, race, parental education, and scores.
* Click on Predict your Maths Score to get an instant result.

**🤖 Future Enhancements**
* Integrate More Models: Add additional advanced machine learning or deep learning models.
* User Authentication: Add user login to save individual progress and predictions.
* Improve UI/UX: Enhance the frontend design with interactive charts or graphs.
